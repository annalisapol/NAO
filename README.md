# NAO Planning AI

This project implements a planning-based artificial intelligence system that generates a sequence of actions for the NAO humanoid robot. The goal is to create an automated pipeline that takes an initial state, evaluates constraints, and produces an optimal or valid set of moves the robot can execute.
